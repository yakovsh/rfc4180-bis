# Introduction
The comma separated values format (CSV) has been used as a common way
to exchange data between disparate systems and applications for many years.
Surprisingly, while this format is very popular, it has never been formally
documented and didn't have a media type registered. This was addressed in 2005 via publication
of {{!RFC4180}} and the concurrent registration of the "text/csv" media type.

Since the publication of {{!RFC4180}}, the CSV format has evolved and this specification
seeks to reflect these changes as well as update the "text/csv" media type registration.

## Terminology
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

## Motivation For and Status of This Document
The original motivation of {{!RFC4180}} was to provide a reference
in order to register the media type "text/csv". It tried to document
existing practices at the time based on the approaches used by most implementations.
This document continues to do the same, and updates the original document to reflect
current practices for generating and consuming of CSV files.

Both {{!RFC4180}} and this document are published as informational RFC for the benefit
of the Internet community and and not intended to be used as formal standards.
Implementers should consult {{?RFC1796}} and {{?RFC2026}} for crucial differences
between IETF standards and informational RFCs.

# Definition of the CSV Format {#format}
While there had been various specifications and implementations for the
CSV format (for ex. {{CREATIVYST}}, {{EDOCEO}}, {{CSVW}} and {{ART}})), prior to publication
of {{!RFC4180}} there is no attempt to provide a common specification. This section documents
the format that seems to be followed by most implementations (incorporating
changes since the publication of {{!RFC4180}}).

## High level description

1. Each record is located on a separate line, ended by a line break (CR, LF or CRLF). For example:

   aaa,bbb,cccCRLF<br/>
   zzz,yyy,xxxCRLF

2. The last record in the file MUST have an ending line break. For example:

   aaa,bbb,cccCRLF<br/>
   zzz,yyy,xxxCRLF

3. The first record in the file MAY be an optional header
with the same format as normal records. This
header will contain names corresponding to the fields in the file
and SHOULD contain the same number of fields as the records in
the rest of the file. For example:

   field_name_1,field_name_2,field_name_3CRLF<br/>
   aaa,bbb,cccCRLF<br/>
   zzz,yyy,xxxCRLF

4. Within each record, there MAY be one or more
fields, separated by commas. Each record SHOULD contain the same
number of fields throughout the file. Spaces are considered part
of a field and SHOULD NOT be ignored. The last field in the
record MUST NOT be followed by a comma. For example:

   aaa,bbb,cccCRLF

5. Each field MAY be enclosed in double quotes (however
some programs, do not use double quotes at all). If fields are not
enclosed with double quotes, then double quotes MUST NOT appear inside the fields.
For example:

   "aaa","bbb","ccc"CRLF<br/>
   zzz,yyy,xxxCRLF

6. Fields containing line breaks (CR, LF or CRLF), double quotes, or commas
MUST be enclosed in double-quotes. The same applies for the first field of
a record that starts with a hash to avoid the field from being parsed as a comment.
For example:

   "aaa","b CRLF<br/>
   bb","ccc"CRLF<br/>
   zzz,yyy,xxxCRLF<br/>
   "#aaa",#bbb,cccCRLF

7. A double-quote appearing inside a field MUST be escaped by preceding it with
another double quote. For example:

   "aaa","b""bb","ccc"CRLF

8. A hash sign MAY be used to mark lines that are meant to be commented lines.
A commented line can contain any whitespace or visible character until it is
terminated by a line break (CR, LF or CRLF).
A comment line MAY appear in any line of the file (before or after an
OPTIONAL header) but MUST NOT be mistaken with a subsequent line of a multi-line
field. Subsequent lines of multi-line fields can start with a hash sign and
MUST NOT interpreted as comments. For example:

    #commentCRLF<br/>
    aaa,bbb,cccCRLF<br/>
    #comment 2CRLF<br/>
    "aaa","this is CRLF<br/>
    # not a comment","ccc"CRLF

## Default charset and line break values
Since the initial publication of {{!RFC4180}}, the default charset for "text/*" media types
has been changed to UTF-8 (as per {{!RFC6657}}) and {{!RFC7111}}.
This document reflects this change and the default charset for CSV files is now UTF-8.

Although section 4.1.1. of {{!RFC2046}} defines CRLF to denote line breaks,
implementers MAY recognize a single CR or LF as a line break (similar to section 3.1.1.3
of {{?RFC7231}}). However, some implementations MAY use other values.

## ABNF Grammar

The ABNF grammar (as per {{!RFC5234}}) appears as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~
file = *((comment / record) linebreak)

comment = hash *comment-data

record = first-field *(comma field)

linebreak = CR / LF / CRLF

first-field = (escaped / first-non-escaped)

field = (escaped / non-escaped)

escaped = DQUOTE *(data-with-hash / comma / CR / LF / 2DQUOTE) DQUOTE

first-non-escaped = [data *data-with-hash]

non-escaped = *data-with-hash

comma = %x2C

hash = %x23

comment-data = WSP / %x21-7E / UTF8-data
         ; characters without control characters

data = WSP / %x21 / %x24-2B / %x2D-7E / UTF8-data
         ; characters without control characters, comma, hash and DQUOTE

data-with-hash = data / hash

CR = %x0D ; as per section B.1 of [RFC5234]

DQUOTE = %x22 ; as per section B.1 of [RFC5234]

LF = %x0A ; as per section B.1 of [RFC5234]

CRLF = CR LF ; as per section B.1 of [RFC5234]

HTAB = %x09 ; as per section B.1 of [RFC5234]

SP = %x20 ; as per section B.1 of [RFC5234]

WSP = SP / HTAB ; as per section B.1 of [RFC5234]

UTF8-data = UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4 ; as per section 4 of [RFC3629]
~~~~~~~~~~

Note that the authoritative definition of UTF-8 is in {{UNICODE}}.

# Common implementation concerns
This section describes some common concerns that may arise when
producing or parsing CSV files. All of these remain out of scope for this document
and are included for awareness. Implementers may also use other means to handle
these use cases such as {{CSVW}}.

## Null values
Some implementations (such as databases) treat empty fields and null values differently.
For these implementations, there is a need to define a special value representing
a null.

Example of a CSV file with nulls (if "NULL" is used to mark nulls):

   field_name_1,field_name_2,field_name_3CRLF<br/>
   aaa,bbb,cccCRLF<br/>
   zzz,NULL,xxxCRLF

## Empty files
Implementers should be aware that in accordance to this specification a file
does not need to contain any comments or records (empty file with zero bytes).

## Empty lines
This specification recommends but doesn't require having the same number of fields
in every line. This allows CSV files to have empty lines without
any fields at all. Some implementations can be configured to skip empty lines
instead of parsing them.

Example of a CSV file with empty lines:

   field_name_1,field_name_2,field_name_3CRLF<br/>
   aaa,bbb,cccCRLF<br/>
   CRLF<br/>
   zzz,yyy,xxxCRLF

However, if the records are only made up of one field it is not possible to
differentiate between an empty line, and an empty and unquoted field. This
differentiation might play an important role in some implementations such
as database exports/imports.

Example of a CSV file with empty lines and only one field per record:

aaa<br/>
CRLF<br/>
bbbCRLF

## Fields spanning multiple lines
When quoted fields are used, it is possible for a field to span multiple lines,
even when line breaks appear within such field.

## Unique header names
Implementers should be aware that some applications may treat header values as unique
(either case-sensitive or case-insensitive).

## Whitespace outside of quoted fields
When quoted fields are used, this document does not allow whitespace
between double quotes and commas. Implementers should be aware that some applications
may be more lenient and allow whitespace outside the double quotes.

## Other field separators
This document defines a comma as a field separator but implementers should be aware
that some applications may use different values, especially with non-English languages.
Those are outside the scope of this document and implementers should consult other
efforts such as {{CSVW}}.

## Escaping double quotes
This document prescribes that a double-quote appearing inside a field
must be escaped by preceding it with another double quote. Implementers should
be aware that some applications may choose to use a different escaping mechanism.

## BOM header
Applications that create text files with unicode character encoding might write
a BOM (byte order mark) header in order to support multiple unicode encodings
(like UTF-16 and UTF-32). Some applications might be able to read and properly
interpret such a header, others could break. Implementors should review
section 6 of {{?RFC3629}} and section 23.8 of {{UNICODE}}.

# Update to MIME Type Registration of text/csv {#registration}

The media type registration of "text/csv" should be updated as per specific
fields below:

Encoding considerations:

> CSV MIME entities can consist of binary data
> as per section 4.8 of {{!RFC6838}}. Although section 4.1.1. of {{!RFC2046}} defines
> CRLF to denote line breaks, implementers MAY recognize a single CR or LF
> as a line break (similar to section 3.1.1.3 of {{!RFC7231}}).
> However, some implementations may use other values.

Published specification:

> While numerous private specifications exist for various programs
> and systems, there is no single "master" specification for this
> format. An attempt at a common definition can be found in {{!RFC4180}}
> and this document. Implementers should note that both documents are informational
> in nature and are not standards.

Optional parameters:  charset

> The "charset" parameter specifies the charset employed by the
> CSV content. In accordance with {{?RFC6657}}, the
> charset parameter SHOULD be used, and if it is not present,
> UTF-8 SHOULD be assumed as the default (this implies that US-
> ASCII CSV will work, even when not specifying the "charset"
> parameter). Any charset defined by IANA for the "text" tree
> may be used in conjunction with the "charset" parameter.

Security considerations:

> Text/csv consists of nothing but passive text data that should
> not pose any direct risks.  However, it is possible that
> malicious data may be included in order to exploit buffer
> overruns or other bugs in the program processing the text/csv
> data.

> Implementers and users should also be aware that some software
> applications may interpret certain characters in the beginning of CSV
> fields as referring to code or formulas, thus resulting in malicious
> code execution. This is known as "CSV injection" and users consuming
> CSV files should filter out such characters.

> The text/csv format provides no confidentiality or integrity
> protection, so if such protections are needed they must be
> supplied externally.

> The fact that software implementing fragment identifiers for
> CSV and software not implementing them differs in behavior, and
> the fact that different software may show documents or
> fragments to users in different ways, can lead to
> misunderstandings on the part of users.  Such misunderstandings
> might be exploited in a way similar to spoofing or phishing.

> Implementers and users of fragment identifiers for CSV text
> should also be aware of the security considerations in RFC 3986
> {{?RFC3986}} and RFC 3987 {{?RFC3987}}.

Interoperability considerations:

> Due to lack of a single specification, there are considerable differences among
> implementations. Implementers should "be conservative in what you
> do, be liberal in what you accept from others" ({{?RFC0793}})
> when processing CSV files. An attempt at a common definition can
> be found in Section 2.

## IANA Considerations

IANA is directed to update the MIME type registration for "text/csv"
as per instructions provided in {{registration}} of this document
and include a reference to this document within the registration.

# Security Considerations

All security considerations discussed in {{registration}} still apply.
